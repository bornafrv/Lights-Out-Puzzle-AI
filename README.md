# 💡 Lights-Out Puzzle AI Solver

This repository contains an AI-based solution to the **Lights-Out Puzzle**, a combinatorial logic game. The objective is to turn off all lights on an *n x n* grid, where toggling one light also toggles its adjacent lights. This project demonstrates the application of various **search algorithms** to efficiently solve the puzzle.
